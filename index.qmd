# Open Time Series Initiative
## Human-Friendly, Machine-Readable, Scientific-Grade Time Series 

Publications from public data providers often target a broad audience, making their datasets inconvenient for research. The opentimeseries R package addresses this by providing reusable code for sourcing public data. It splits data into a long format CSV file and metadata into a JSON file, ensuring the output is user-friendly for both humans and machines.

## Vintages: Versioned Time Series for Researchers 

Why do forecasters need their vintages?

A: Forecasters working with time series data need vintages to compare past forecasts with actual outcomes, understand data revisions over time, and improve the accuracy of future predictions. Vintages provide a historical record of data as it was available at different points in time, which is crucial for evaluating and refining forecasting models.
