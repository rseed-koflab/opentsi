# The Hacking for Science Course 

By popular demand, we're bringing the Hacking for Science course back to the D-MTEC PhD program in fall 2024.
The course will open to guests from all departments as well as interested guests. 
We are currently updating the course website, stay tuned and subscribe to our newsletter in the meantime. 

To learn more about the course, including an initial schedule, check our [blog post on the h4sci project](posts/h4sci/).

The use of data, knowing how to use it correctly, but also how to make your own data available for others to use so that they can work with it in a suitable way, are important prerequisites in today’s world. As a data producer on the one hand and a data user on the other, KOF can play an important bridging role and bring together data producers and academic users in particular. I am looking forward to the exciting process of helping to build this bridge. - Dr. Klaus Abberger

Over the last two decades, we have witnessed programming, and source code in particular, become a tremendously sharp, illustrative and hence increasingly popular communication channel across many fields of research. RSEED picks up this chance to leverage our resources: Reproducible dissemination of results, interactive communication of methodological advances and truly accessible data, make research more inclusive, increase its reach and therefore its impact. - Dr. Matthias Bannert

RSEED is a key resource in our data-centric age, where the availability of microdata, software expertise and analytical skills are becoming increasingly important. The potential of RSEED as a basis for sound economic policy analysis is immense. So it’s not just about having access to data, it’s about being able to unlock its potential through improved analytical skills. It is very exciting to be part of this project. - Prof. Dr. Martin Wörter

Integrating data from all over Switzerland here at KOF will supercharge its usefulness for the social sciences. To make this a reality, we need to do lots of engineering. As an IT specialist with a fondness for economic research, I will contribute my expertise and many lines of code to this promising venture. - Oliver Müller

RSEED is a particularly promising field of research for my work in democracy and innovation. For the citizens in any democracy, enhanced, equal access to data as well as data quality can be defined as public goods. Enhanced data and a programming-driven approach to the analysis of these data are also the basis needed for innovation in the collective decision-making processes we examine in our research, with the goal to improve democracy and to ensure long-term welfare for society. - Prof. Dr. Hans Gersbach

RSEED has the potential to make data accessible beyond its current reach of data scientists and software engineers. I want to help grow the RSEED section and develop our community. - Minna Heim
